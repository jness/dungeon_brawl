    "You choose nonmagical flame that you can see within range and that fits within a 5-foot cube. You affect it in one of the following ways:",

    " * You instantaneously extinguish the flames within the cube.",
    " * You double or halve the area of bright light and dim light cast by the flame, change its color, or both. The change lasts for 1 hour.",
