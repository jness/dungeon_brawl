  A nature spirit answers your call and transforms you into a powerful guardian. The transformation lasts until the spell ends. You choose one of the following forms to assume: Primal Beast or Great Tree.

  Primal Beast. Bestial fur covers your body, your facial feature becomes feral, and you gain the following benefits.

   * Your walking speed increases by 10 feet.

   * You gain darkvision with a range of 120 feet.

   * You make Strength-based attack rolls with advantage.

   * Your melee weapon attacks deal an extra 1d6 force damage on a hit.

  Great Tree. Your skin appears barky, leaves sprout from your hair, and you gain the following benefits:

   * You gain 10 temporary hit points.

   * You make Constitution saving throws with advantage.

   * You make Dexterity- and Wisdom-based attack rolls with advantage.

   * While you are on the ground, the ground within 15 feet of you is difficult terrain for your enemies.
